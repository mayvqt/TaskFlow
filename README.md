## Architecture

TaskFlow is built using a clean, modular architecture following MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) patterns:

### Technology Stack
- **.NET 8.0**: Latest .NET framework for optimal performance
- **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)**: Modern Windows desktop UI framework
- **Material Design In XAML**: Beautiful, consistent UI components
- **Microsoft.Extensions**: Dependency injection, logging, and hosting
- **Newtonsoft.Json**: Configuration serialization
- **System.ServiceProcess**: Windows service interaction

### Core Components

#### Services Layer
- **ProcessMonitorService**: Handles application lifecycle and real-time monitoring
- **SchedulingService**: Manages scheduled tasks and automatic execution
- **ConfigurationService**: Handles JSON-based configuration persistence
- **ApplicationManagementService**: Manages application CRUD operations and system info

#### Models
- **MonitoredApplication**: Represents a monitored application with status tracking
- **ScheduleTask**: Represents a scheduled task with timing and action definitions
- **AppConfiguration**: Application settings and configuration structure

#### ViewModels (MVVM Pattern)
- **MainWindowViewModel**: Main UI logic with command handling and data binding
- **ViewModelBase**: Base class providing INotifyPropertyChanged implementation
- **RelayCommand**: Command implementation for button actions

#### Views
- **MainWindow**: Material Design WPF interface with tabbed layout
- **Custom Controls**: Material Design components for modern UI

### Key Features Implementation

#### Real-time Monitoring
- Timer-based process checking every 5 seconds
- Automatic status updates via data binding
- Event-driven UI updates for responsive interface

#### Process Management
- Graceful shutdown with fallback to force termination
- Process ID tracking and validation
- Automatic restart capabilities with configurable retry limits

#### Dependency Injection

- Clean separation of concerns

## Configuration Examples

### Application Configuration Structure
```json
{
  "Id": "unique-app-id",
  "Name": "My Web Server",
  "ExecutablePath": "C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\MyApp\\start.bat",
  "Arguments": "--port 8080 --env production",
  "WorkingDirectory": "C:\\inetpub\\wwwroot\\MyApp",
  "IsEnabled": true,
  "StartupDelay": "00:00:30",
  "RestartOnCrash": true,
  "MaxRestartAttempts": 3,
  "CurrentRestartAttempts": 0
}
```

### Schedule Configuration
```json
{
  "Id": "schedule-id",
  "ApplicationId": "unique-app-id",
  "Name": "Daily Restart at 3 AM",
  "ScheduleType": 3,
  "Action": 2,
  "Time": "03:00:00",
  "IsEnabled": true
}
```

### Complete Configuration File Example
See `sample-config.json` in the project root for a complete example with:
- Web server application with startup and daily restart schedules
- Database backup service with startup schedule
- Comprehensive application settings

### Schedule Types
- `0` = None
- `1` = Startup (runs when TaskFlow starts)
- `2` = Interval (runs every X time)
- `3` = Daily (runs at specific time each day)
- `4` = Weekly (runs on specific day/time each week)

### Action Types
- `0` = Start application
- `1` = Stop application
- `2` = Restart application

## Logging and Troubleshooting

### Log Levels
TaskFlow uses Microsoft.Extensions.Logging with these levels:
- **Information**: Normal application events and operations
- **Warning**: Recoverable issues, restart attempts, unexpected behavior
- **Error**: Application failures, startup errors, critical issues

### Log Locations
- **Real-time Logs**: View in the "Logs" tab within the application
- **Persistent Logs**: Stored in `%APPDATA%\TaskFlow\logs\` (when file logging is enabled)

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Application Won't Start
1. Check if the executable path exists and is accessible
2. Verify the working directory is correct
3. Ensure the application has proper permissions
4. Check the Logs tab for detailed error messages

#### Process Monitoring Issues
1. Verify the application is not running as a different user
2. Check if antivirus software is blocking process access
3. Ensure TaskFlow is running with appropriate privileges

#### Configuration Problems
1. Validate JSON syntax in the configuration file
2. Check file permissions for `%APPDATA%\TaskFlow\config.json`
3. Use the provided `sample-config.json` as a reference
